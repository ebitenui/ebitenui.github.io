The most basic way to present the user interface in an application is to break it up into nested containers with different layouts, inside which widgets are located for interaction.

<!--more-->

The library provides a rendering manager in 
which you will place your entire UI. The manager is located in `ebitenui` package.
```go
import "github.com/ebitenui/ebitenui"
```

Manager needs to get constantly `updated` and `drawed`.
```go
type Game struct {
	ui *ebitenui.UI
}

 func NewGame() *Game {
    return &Game{
		ui: &ebitenui.UI{},
	}
}

func (g *Game) Update() error {
	g.ui.Update()
	return nil
}

func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
	g.ui.Draw(screen)
}
```

Any UI in this library consists of containers that are nested in each other. Container is located in `widget` package.
```go
import "github.com/ebitenui/ebitenui/widget"
```

The manager is contains a reference to the `root` container and responsible for delivering events throughout the user interface.
Let's pass our container there so we can interact with it. There is `only one container type` which can be created like this.
```go
func NewGame() *Game {
    root := widget.NewContainer()
    return &Game{
        ui: &ebitenui.UI{Container: root},
    }
}
```

The standard library has a package with default colors that that will be useful to us, like: {{< color Indianred >}}, {{< color Goldenrod >}}, {{< color Steelblue >}}, {{< color Mediumseagreen >}}, {{< color Darkslategray >}}, {{< color Gainsboro >}}.

```go
import "golang.org/x/image/colornames"
```

The library draws all interface elements using multiple image tiles also known as [nine-slice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling) to prevent image scaling distortion. That package will help us to work with images.

```go
import "github.com/ebitenui/ebitenui/image"
```

We have everything to get the first result. The container have several options to setup, like background color.

```go
root := widget.NewContainer(
    widget.ContainerOpts.BackgroundImage(
        image.NewNineSliceColor(colornames.Gainsboro),
    ),
)
```

Lets run the app. We will see a single container that will take up all the free space.

{{< /expand >}}


Containers can be composed into each other. The order adding child containers does not matter.

```go
left := widget.NewContainer(
	widget.ContainerOpts.BackgroundImage(
		image.NewNineSliceColor(colornames.Indianred),
	),
)
right := widget.NewContainer(
	widget.ContainerOpts.BackgroundImage(
		image.NewNineSliceColor(assets.Steelblue),
	),
)
root := widget.NewContainer(
	widget.ContainerOpts.BackgroundImage(
		image.NewNineSliceColor(colornames.Gainsboro),
	),
)
root.AddChild(left)
root.AddChild(right)
```

To prevent child containers from overlapping each other, we can specify how they are positioned within the parent container using other container properties, such as layout.

```go
root := widget.NewContainer(
    widget.ContainerOpts.Layout(widget.NewAnchorLayout()),
)
```

Positioning within the layout is specified by the `LayoutData` structure inside each container. In addition, at least, each container `must have a minimum size`.

```go
left := widget.NewContainer(
    widget.ContainerOpts.WidgetOpts(
        widget.WidgetOpts.LayoutData(widget.AnchorLayoutData{
            HorizontalPosition: widget.AnchorLayoutPositionStart,
            StretchVertical:    true,
        }),
        widget.WidgetOpts.MinSize(50, 50),
    ),
)
```

Let's set similar options for other containers.

{{< code src="assets/examples/bas_con_mul.txt" lang="go" id="this">}}

Let's launch the application. We will see one `root container` in background and two `child containers` inside at different `position` that will `stretch` vertically.

The library has several different layouts for different situations, you can study each of them in detail on the next pages.
